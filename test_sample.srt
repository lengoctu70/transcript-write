00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome to this introduction to machine learning course.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this lecture, we will discuss the fundamental concepts of neural networks and deep learning.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Machine learning is basically a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much the model is changed in response to the estimated error.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in the human brain.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks by calculating gradients.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts parameters to minimize the loss function.
